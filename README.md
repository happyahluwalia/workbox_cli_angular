# AngularShell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

The plan for this project is to be the shell program to be used in future angular projects. This would be PWA with a quick startup time, service worker, manifest and the whole nine yards :-) Thats the plan.
